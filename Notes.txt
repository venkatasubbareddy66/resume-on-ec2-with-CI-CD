1 EC2_SSH_KEY: this will be your .pem file which you will use to login to the instance 


Why we are creating this key ? 

ANS : .pem file it is used to login into instance on behalf of us , we are allowing GitHub will login into the instance to make changes for that we have to create secrete allow the GitHub repository talk to the ec2 instance 

How to do this ?
